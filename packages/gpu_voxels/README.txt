We would be grateful if scientific publications resulting from projects that make use of GPU-Voxels would cite our overview paper:
A. Hermann, F. Drews, J. Bauer, S. Klemm, A. Roennau and R. Dillmann:
“Unified GPU Voxel Collision Detection for Mobile Manipulation Planning”
in Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2014, Chicago, September 2014)


The research leading to the results has received funding from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under grant agreement no. 01IM12006C (ISABEL).
