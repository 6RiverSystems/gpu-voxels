If you have questions or experience any problems with the software, please subscribe our 
mailinglist at https://listserv.fzi.de/mailman/listinfo/gpu-voxels
and post to gpu-voxels@listserv.fzi.de

The library is developed and maintained by:
Andreas Hermann

Contributors are (in temporal order):
Sebastian Klemm
Florian Drews
Matthias Wagner
Felix Mauch
Christian Jülg
Herbert Pietrzyk


We would be grateful if scientific publications resulting from projects that make use of GPU-Voxels would cite our overview paper:
A. Hermann, F. Drews, J. Bauer, S. Klemm, A. Roennau and R. Dillmann:
“Unified GPU Voxel Collision Detection for Mobile Manipulation Planning”
in Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2014, Chicago, September 2014)


The research leading to the results has received funding from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under grant agreement no. 01IM12006C (ISABEL).


BUILDING:

Install dependencies:
 Core: 
    CUDA > 5.5, 
    PCL,
    OpenNI,
    Boost
 Visualizer: 
    GLEW (libglew, libglew-dev)
    GLM (libglm-dev)
    OpenGL
    GLUT (freeglut3, freeglut3-dev)
 Examples:
    Some examples require ROS (Robot Operation System) for parsing Robot Descriptions (URDF) and to interface 3D cameras

Compiling:
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake ..
 make

==> This will also generate example programs and a visualization tool to see some live demos.

Doxygen files can be generated by
make doc
