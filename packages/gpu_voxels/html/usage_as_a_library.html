<h3>Use GPU-Voxels in own projects</h3>
<p>Do a <em><strong>make install</strong></em> to export the Binaries and the required headers into the <em><strong>export</strong></em> directory to link against them from another Build-Environment. We use this with ROS, where we generated planning and collision testing nodes that link against the ic_workspace.</p>
